# Machine-Learning

**Linear Regression:** Developed a Machine Learning Model from scratch in Python and Pandas to predict Airfoil noise levels. Applied Linear Regression with Gradient Descent to the model using NumPy for calculating the predictions.

**Neural Networks:** Developed a Neural Network Model using Python and Scikit to predict forest fires from an Algerian dataset. Manipulated hyper-parameters like activation functions, learning rates, epochs, number of layers and number of nodes per layer to improve accuracy and reduce error.
