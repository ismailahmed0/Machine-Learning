Developed a Neural Network Model using Python and Scikit to predict forest fires from an Algerian dataset. Manipulated hyper-parameters like activation functions, learning rates, epochs, number of layers and number of nodes per layer to improve accuracy and reduce error.

neural_network.py outputs the accuracy and error of each hyper-parameter model for the training and testing data.

Report.pdf contains a summary of the code, a very brief analysis, logs of the results and plots comparing the results of the hyper-parameter changes.
