Developed a Machine Learning Model from scratch in Python and Pandas to predict Airfoil noise levels.
Applied Linear Regression with Gradient Descent to the model using NumPy for calculating the predictions.

part1.py is the model built from scratch and part2.py is the model built using existing sklearn libraries.
Make sure to have pandas, numpy and sklearn installed.
